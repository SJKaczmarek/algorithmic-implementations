# Algorithmic Implementations

This folder contains code implementations of various algorithms, exploring different areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

## Published Implementations:

1. **xlstmtime_model.py**

   This Python file provides a PyTorch implementation of the xLSTMTime model, a novel architecture for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). xLSTMTime leverages the strengths of the extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) model, incorporating exponential gating and a revised memory structure to effectively capture temporal dependencies in time series data. 

   A detailed review of xLSTMTime, including its architecture, performance benchmarks, and potential impact on the LTSF landscape, can be found in the article: [xLSTMTime: A Competitive Recurrent Architecture for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/xlstmtime-competitive-recurrent-architecture-time-series-kaczmarek-jdmpe/).

2. **Stay Tuned for More** 

   This repository will continue to expand with new algorithmic implementations. Follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/SJKaczmarek/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sylvesterkaczmarek/) to stay updated on the latest additions.
